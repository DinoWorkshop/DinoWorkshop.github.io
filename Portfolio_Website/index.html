       While this is my portfolio, it's all work and progress and I'll probably
        never be finished with this fully.<br>
        There's always room for improvement if you want my honest opinion about personal projects like this.<br>
        I'll probably keep updating and adding stuff as long as I'm alive, I'm never always satisfied with my work.
