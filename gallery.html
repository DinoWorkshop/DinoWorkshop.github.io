<p>
So near the start of this program, we were tasked with picking a movie of our choice and told
to make a minimalist poster based on it. Believe me, I had an entire page of me brainstorming
films and ideas to pick for this. The Transformers: The Movie from 1986 ultimately won
out of all of them, but one of the previous candidates will be revisited later on in
the gallery. I mainly picked it because this is still the best Transformers film with
the only real competition being Bumblebee from 2018. It also introduced a lot of staple
characters, settings, and tons of new layers of worldbuilding to the Transformers universe.
The film is also infamous for killing Optimus Prime, and unlike modern media, they stuck with
that decision far into the cartoon's third season that followed.
</p>

<p>
I had an idea right away for this design, I wanted to convey just how drastically this
film changed everything for transformers. The Autobot and Decepticon logos in space was
directly based on the intro for the cartoon's second season, which proceeds the movie.
The poster is supposed to convey that this unknown threat is a danger to all the
transformers as a whole. It's something far greater than the simple energy war of the
past. To that end, I think I did a decent job. I wouldn't change much other than the
background and some shading on Unicron.

<!--Black Hole Poster 1-->
<fieldset class="piece2and3">
  <legend><b>The Black Hole Posters</b></legend>

  <img src="./Assets/Images/black_hole_poster.jpg" alt="The Black Hole Poster" class="blackhole2">
  <p>
    So here is yet another movie poster were tasked to work on, also for a film of choice.
    Remember how I mentioned multiple candidates in the last section? This film was one of
    those candidates I was considering. While this is far from the best Disney film, Black Hole
    has such a weird and fascinating story behind it's production and I really like what
    it does manage to pull off. It's essentially a disaster movie in space with some of the worst
    and greatest practical effects I've ever seen. The buildup to the end is also phenomal.
  </p>

<p>
  So while the film is known for being Disney's first PG film, that rating has lost any meaning
  since then. While watching the film I noticed a few tweaks could easily turn it into a horror
  film in space. That thought was the insiration for the direction I wanted to take with this poster.
  I wanted it to look menacing and my only real rules was that it had to include the following;
  Maximillian, one of the main antagonists, the ship USS Cygnus, the setting, and the titular
  black hole itself. I have a reason for making the poster mostly red but I won't explain
  why for spoiler reasons.
</p>

<p>
We were also instructed to make an alternate poster for our movie of choice. For the one on the right I decided
take a different angle. with the first poster, Maximillian, the USS Cygnus, and the black hole were
must haves. I actually dropped Maximillian and instead took a shot from the interior of the ship instead,
then just simply got the same black hole image used for the first poster and messed around with <thead>
blending options. Considering it was admittedly a bit of a rushed job, I quite like how it looks!
It's a play on that iconic shot where the protagonists are running across the bridge with a meteor
rolling towards the camera. The blending options almost makes it look like the three are being
disintergrated by the titular black hole itself. Once again I was aiming for that untapped
horror aspect of the film.
