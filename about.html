      <h1>Who made this, anyway?</h1>
    <p> Well I'm glad you asked! I'm Andrew and, at the time of making the first version
      of this site, am currently attending F.I.R.S.T for graphics design and web development.
      It's been a bit of a weird ride but I'm glad to have taken it. My main reason was just
      trying to learn more about how to get ideas out of my head and into a more tangible form,
      honestly. I tend to brainstorm a lot in my freetime and it's a bit irritating I can't entirely
      manifest my imagination to the fullest extent. So to that end, I decided to take this course
      and practice art when I'm not busy in order to fix that! </p>
