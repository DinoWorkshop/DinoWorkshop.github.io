<h1 class="text-white text-center animate__animated animate__bounceIn" id="bio"> All about me! </h1>

<br>

<p class="text-white text-center animate__animated animate__fadeIn" id="bio_para_1"> Well, you were probably wondering about who was behind the scenes of this site, huh?
  I'm Andrew, fresh out F.I.R.S.T's graphics design course. Visuals have always been something that caught my interest, but I honestly
  never thought about pursuing until I attended an open house event with my father and sister. Our tour guide asked if I had an interest in graphics
  design because of the shirt I was wearing along with a hoodie that matched in terms of color. I know it's a small starting point, but that really is what
  got me thinking about it. </p>

<br>

<p class="text-white text-center animate__animated animate__fadeIn" id="bio_para_2"> My favorite projects have mostly been the movie posters if you couldn't tell from the gallery, but I'm also interested in
  practicing toy photography. I also tend to work on a lot of other things in my freetime like drawing and writing.
  I feel like my interests are all over the place sometimes, but I don't think it's a bad thing. In my eyes, it's just a massive pool
  of inspirations to draw from. </p>

<br>

<p class="text-danger text-center animate__animated animate__fadeIn" id="bio_para_3"> Now I'll be real with you for a second,
  while I'm still sorting out pricing for commissions, don't even dare asking me about doing projects
  with exposure instead of real payment. I have no tolerance for that and will promptly ignore you
  if you try to undermine me and my work just so you can be cheap. The only exceptions are internships and close family. </p>
